player character: divide each frame by 32x32
door: divide each frame by 64x64
green & red light: divide each frame by 64x64

(See the example iamge that I added)

For the animation speed, I don't have control over it right now.
I believe you can set the speed of animation inside the

If you're running the game at the speed of 30 frames per sec,
You'll probably have to slow down the animation speed.
